                        <p>Animal Shelter – Many animals in Kenya suffer from neglect, cruelty and abuse. We run a shelter for 
                            animals in need; such as lost animals or victims of cruelty. We provide care and a safe environment until 
                            animals are reclaimed or re-homed to carefully vetted new owners.
                            Investigations and Rescue – We respond to over 6000 calls per year to give help and advice to owners on pet 
                            care.
                            Education & Advocacy – We arrange and encourage school visits to the shelter to teach children about the 
                            importance of animal welfare.
                            Spay/Neuter Campaigns – We feel strongly that overpopulation of cats and dogs should be controlled by 
                            sterilization rather than by the killing of healthy animals. The KSPCA conducts spay and neuter campaigns 
                            in lower income areas when funds are available.
                            Humane Slaughter– KSPCA was instrumental in introducing humane slaughter of livestock to Kenya. After having 
                            seen the way animals suffer in abattoirs, we embarked on a humane slaughter programme promoting the use of 
                            captive bolt pistols. We import captive bolt pistols and blank ammunition, which are sold to abattoirs at 
                            cost price. Our inspectors teach slaughter house staff on proper use of captive bolt pistols and their maintenance.
