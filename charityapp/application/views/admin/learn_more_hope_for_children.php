                        <p> Hope for Children Kenya was started in the year 2000 and registered in 2010 as a goodwill for giving 
                            back to the community and also as a way of appreciating life because of the nature of the life the founder 
                            went through as a young girl. Pamela Adhiambo (Director), was born in the rural set up of Nyanza Kenya under 
                            the true hardship of poverty. Because of this, she only managed to learn up to grade 4 and dropped out of 
                            school to face the true nature of survival as a young girl working as a house help in Nairobi. She got 
                            married at an early age with the hope of getting a better life but that was not the case and after several 
                            attempts without success, because of being abused and battered, she settled down to be a single woman raising 
                            her three children as a business woman. Based on her life story of not being able to go to school, she decided
                            that she would give unfortunate children from different backgrounds the opportunity she never had and thus, 
                            the orphanage was born.
                            Hope for Children Kenya is a home that provides shelter to 60 orphans and vulnerable children (31 boys and 29 
                            girls) who may have lost hope. We raise the children under the umbrella of a family, where the founder and home 
                            matron, Pamela, takes the position as the mother of all the children. We aim to give each and every child an opportunity 
                            to dream again, rekindle hopes and create new life stories which will transform their lives to have a positive worldview.
