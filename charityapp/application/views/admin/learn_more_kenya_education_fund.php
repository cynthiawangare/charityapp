                        <p> The story of KEF weaves together the rich histories of three organizations,  
                            the Kenya Education Fund (est. 2006), the Nomadic Kenyan Children’s Educational 
                            Fund (NKCEF, est. 2001) and the Children of Kibera Foundation (est. 2007).
                            KEF has over 20 years of collective experience working to promote education in Kenya.
                            KEF was started by former Peace Corps Volunteer, Bradley Broder and local community leader, Dominic Muasya, 
                            to keep kids in high school when their means did not allow. 
                            NKCEF was formed after a group of families from McLean, Virginia 
                            accompanied their children’s high school teacher, Hon. Joseph Lekuton, on a 
                            trip to his nomadic homeland in Northern Kenya where many of the children were not in school. 
                            NKCEF combined with KEF in 2011.
                            Children of Kibera Foundation was founded by Honorable Ken Okoth (Kibera) and provided hundreds of 
                            educational scholarships to primary, secondary and university students from Kibera –Africa’s largest slum. 
                            CoKF merged with KEF in 2013.
                            KEF works closely with Red Rose Primary School, a quality private facility in Kibera Slum, Nairobi, to ensure 
                            that many of their students will transition to high school with KEF Scholarships.  Kibera is the largest slum 
                            in Africa, with an estimated 60% of school aged children out of school.
                            Each year, KEF awards 30  exemplary KEF graduates with a University Bridge Scholarship which provides tuition 
                            fees and boarding for their first year of University.  Most KEF Bridge Scholars receive student loans in their 
                            second year from the Higher Education Loan Board, helping them complete their university degree.
