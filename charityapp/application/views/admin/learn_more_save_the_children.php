                        <p> Save the Children has been on the ground in Kenya since September 2016 conducting nutritional screenings 
                            and treatments in 149 sites in four of the driest counties in the north. 
                            Save the Children is among the lead agencies working with Kenya’s Humanitarian Partners Team at the national 
                            level to identify, treat and prevent hunger and malnutrition.
                            Our teams are training health workers to identify and treat children for malnutrition and are providing 
                            infant- and child-feeding programs to mothers. We have rolled out screenings for malnutrition, reaching over 
                            19,000 children five years old and younger, and more than 10,000 pregnant women.
                            In addition, we are helping keep schools and health facilities open by trucking in clean water and providing 
                            technical assistance in water, well and storage systems. And we are helping communities prepare for and 
                            prevent future crises by providing technical assistance to develop and implement response plans.
                            As a global leader in child health, Save the Children keeps children healthy and thriving. 
                            We led the massive worldwide effort that helped reduce newborn deaths by over 40% since 2000, saving 1.5 million 
                            babies each year. Still, an estimated 5.3 million young children die each year from entirely preventable diseases, 
                            such as pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea. 
                            As COVID-19 continues to spread globally, health systems around the world are overwhelmed. Children’s access to routine 
                            health services and nutritious food is in danger. High levels of hunger and malnutrition have also been exacerbated by 
                            the pandemic. 
                            We know the world’s children deserve better. As the world’s leading expert on childhood, we have the expertise and the 
                            global presence to deliver what’s needed now for children.
