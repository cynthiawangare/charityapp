                        <p> Established in 2007, the Women’s Empowerment Link (WEL) is a non- profit, nonpartisan, 
                            non-governmental women rights organization. We invest in empowering women and girls to 
                            realize their full potential, worth and strength politically, socially and economically 
                            through advocating for their human and social justice rights.
                            WEL recognizes that the survival of women and their communities is increasingly challenged 
                            by economic dependency, illiteracy, gender inequalities & marginalization, HIV/AIDS, Sexual & 
                            Gender Based Violence (SGBV), conflict, insensitive laws and policies.
                            Ending violence against women and girls remains one of the most serious and ongoing challenges worldwide. 
                            Women’s Empowerment Link – WEL focuses on Elimination of Violence against Women & Girls by facilitating 
                            development, promotion and enforcement of appropriate mechanisms for prevention, protection and response 
                            to violence against women.
                            WEL’s prevention and response working groups in Nairobi, Naivasha and Mombasa has facilitated support for 
                            over 74,000 members of the communities.
                            WEL establishes multi-sectoral community VAWG working groups with membership from government, CBOs, FBOs, 
                            women and youth groups.
